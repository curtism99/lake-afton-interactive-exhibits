# Lake Afton Public Observatory Interactive Exhibits
Web-based interactive slideshows and infographics for tablets and computers at the Lake Afton Public Observatory.

## Presentations
The purpose of this repository is to provide an open-source code-base for a group of interactive displays and exhibits at Lake Afton Public Observatory. Initially this
repo was simply a placeholder for converted PowerPoint but we can do a lot more. Feel free to update information on existing slides, add new slides or entire presentations, or
even add completely new functionality. Examples could be:
- Videos
- Games
- Slideshows
- Quizzes

## Setup
To setup this repo,
- clone it to your local machine however you like,
- make sure the reveal.js code is present in /node_modules/ by using NPM to install reveal.js, or just manually placing the files in /src/js/reveal.js/
- place the updated binaries in /src/img/
- You're all set.

## Binaries
- A bunch of images are required for this repo. They can be [downloaded here](http://bit.ly/2bII3mF) and placed in /src/img/
- Try to keep photos no larger than 1280x800
- If you add photos, please modify the above link to point to a new location with the COMPLETE /src/img/ folder so it's up to date.

## Code
- The files in this repo will be hosted on a server on-site using a static IP of 192.168.1.200 - make sure "home" links point there.
- Code documentation can be found on [Github](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
- Please use existing exhibits as a template, avoid too much custom CSS.
- If you want to add a new feature discuss you may submit a pull request but we'd love to chat about it first. Send questions to [Seth Duncan](sduncan@lakeafton.com) or [Michael Neth](mneth@lakeafton.com).

## Technology
- These presentations will be running on Raspberry Pi powered 10" touchscreens running 1280x800 resolution. Please take these constraints into consideration.
- [Reveal JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) is required for the presentations. Use NPM to install reveal.js or just stick the reveal.js directory in /node_modules/
