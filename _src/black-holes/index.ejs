          <ul>
			<li>A black hole is a region of spacetime from which nothing can escape, even light!</li>
            <li>Black holes have the most matter stuffed into the least space of any objects in the universe!</li>
            <li>The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.</li>

			<h2>How to Become a Black Hole</h2>
            <img style="float:left;margin-right:50px;width:50%;height:50%;" data-src="/img/black-holes/supernova.jpg" />
			<p>A star burns energy in the form of nuclear fuel. When a star runs out of fuel, it can no longer generate any push against the gravity of all its mass. The gravity forces everything toward the center of the star and the core collapses into a black hole.</p>

          <h2>2 Types of Black Holes</h2><br/>
			  <ol>
					<li>1. Stellar Black Hole</li>
					<li>2. Supermassive Black Hole</li>

        <section> <!-- Stellar Black Holes -->
			<h2>Stellar Black Holes</h2>
            <img style="float:left;margin-right:50px;width:50%;height:50%;" data-src="/img/black-holes/stellar-black-hole.jpg" />
            <p>Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. The outer layers of the star explode in what is called a <i>supernova</i>.</p>
          </section>

          <section> <!--Supermassive Black Holes-->
			<h2>Supermassive Black Holes</h2>
            <img style="float:left;margin-right:50px;" data-src="/img/black-holes/supermassive-black-hole.jpg" />
            <p>These super-sized black holes are formed as the result of many black holes combining into one enormous black hole. Scientists think they were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.</p>

            <p>2 Black holes can actually exist next to each other! We call this a binary black hole. They orbit around each other!</p>

			<h2>If black holes are black & in space, how can we see them?!</h2><br/>
			<p>Scientists can see how the strong gravity of a black hole affects the stars and gas around it. Scientists can study stars to find out if they are flying around, or orbiting, a black hole.</p><br/>
			<p>When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light can not be seen with human eyes. Scientists use satellites and telescopes in space to see the high-energy light.</p>
