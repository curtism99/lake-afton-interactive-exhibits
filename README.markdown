# Lake Afton Public Observatory Interactive Exhibits
Web-based interactive slideshows and infographics for tablets and computers at the Lake Afton Public Observatory.

## Presentations
The purpose of this repository is to provide an open-source codebase for a group of interactive displays and exhibits at Lake Afton Public Observatory. Initially this
repo was simply a placeholder for converted PowerPoint but we can do a lot more. Feel free to update information on existing slides, add new slides or entire presentations, or
even add completely new functionality. Examples could be:
- Videos
- Games
- Slideshows
- Quizzes

## Setup
To setup this repo:
1. Clone it to your local machine however you like
2. Place the updated [binaries](#binaries) in `/src/`
3. You're all set

## Binaries
- A bunch of images and videos are required for this project. They can be [downloaded here](http://bit.ly/2bII3mF) and the `img` and `video` folders placed in `/src/`.
- Try to keep photos no larger than 1280x800
- If you add photos, please modify the above link to point to a new location with the COMPLETE `/src/` folder so it's up to date.

## Code
- The files in this repo will be hosted on a server on-site using a static IP of 192.168.1.200 - make sure "home" links point there.
- Code documentation can be found on [Github](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
- Please use existing exhibits as a template, avoid too much custom CSS.
- If you want to add a new feature discuss you may submit a pull request but we'd love to chat about it first. Send questions to [Seth Duncan](sduncan@lakeafton.com) or [Michael Neth](mneth@lakeafton.com).

## Technology
- These presentations will be running on Raspberry Pi powered 10" touchscreens running 1280x800 resolution. Please take these constraints into consideration.
- Powered by [Reveal JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)
